# 3D Mountain View | OPENGL App

I used principles such as cube mapping for mapping the night-sky, particle system for generating a waterfall, and reflection of light from multiple sources to reflect light on the lake.  
It is a project meant to verify knowledge, so it doesn't have much functionality, but it may be a good start for a bigger project.

This app runs on a framework. Once you download it, you can open it using **CMake**. After opening the project, navigate to:  
`GFXFramework/src/lab_m2/tema12`  
That's where you'll find the source code.  
In the `main.cpp` file, you can choose which file to run. It is already set to run **tema12**. Once you press **run**, a window should open with the app running. :)  
Note: Full-screen mode has a bug, so it only works as it is.
